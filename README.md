## Key Features

- Add Multiple Images: Add any local image or GIF to your canvas.
- Easy Manipulation: Drag, drop, resize, and delete items with an intuitive interface.
- Dynamic Canvas: Set the canvas to your screen's resolution or define a custom size.
- One-Click Overlay: Apply your entire creation as a transparent, click-through overlay on your desktop.
- System Tray Integration: Minimize the app to the system tray to keep it running in the background without cluttering your taskbar.

## How to Use

- Add Images: Click the "Add Image/GIF" button to add your files to the canvas.
- Arrange: Click and drag your images to position them. Select an image to see handles for resizing and deleting.
- Apply Overlay: Once you're happy with your layout, click "Apply as Overlay."
- Manage: Use "Remove Overlay" to take it down or "Minimize to Tray" to hide the main window.
