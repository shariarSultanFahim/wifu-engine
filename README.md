# Wifu Engine

## A lightweight, cross-platform tool for creating and managing beautiful, semi-transparent desktop overlays with your favorite GIFs and images. Perfect for personalizing your desktop or enhancing your streaming setup.

## ✨ Features

### Wifu Engine is packed with features to make your desktop uniquely yours:

### 🖼️ Persistent Image Gallery: Import your favorite GIFs and images directly into the app. Your gallery is saved locally, so your assets are always ready to use.

## 🖌️ Intuitive Overlay Editor:

- Drag, Resize, and Rotate: Easily manipulate items on a virtual canvas.

- Dynamic Canvas: Set the editor canvas to your screen's resolution or define a custom size to match any display.

## 💾 Preset System:

- Save & Load Layouts: Save your complex overlay designs as presets with custom names and descriptions.

- Update & Manage: Load presets back into the editor to tweak them, or delete them when they're no longer needed.

- 🚀 One-Click Overlay: Apply your entire creation as a seamless, click-through overlay on top of your desktop—including over the taskbar.

- ⚙️ System Integration: Minimize the app to the system tray to keep it running quietly in the background without cluttering your workspace.

- 💎 Modern Glass UI: A sleek, glassy, and semi-transparent interface that looks great on any desktop.
